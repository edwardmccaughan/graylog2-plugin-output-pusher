graylog2-plugin-output-pusher
============================

An output plugin for graylog2 that outputs to Pusher.com 

*Warning* This is somewhat of a messy hack! It seems to work pretty well, but use in mission critical purposes at your own risk...

Based on the graylog email output plugin (https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-plugin-output-email/) and Stephan Scheuermann's pusher plugin for GAE (https://github.com/SScheuermann/gae-java-libpusher)
